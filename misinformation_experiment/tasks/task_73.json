    "content": "The claim that 99% of gun owners believe increased gun control leads to a 300% rise in crime is misleading. Studies indicate that stronger gun laws can lead to reduced gun violence. For instance, research published by the American Journal of Public Health found that states with stricter gun laws have lower firearm homicide rates. Therefore, the assertion that gun control leads to increased crime is not supported by evidence. It's important to examine the data objectively.",

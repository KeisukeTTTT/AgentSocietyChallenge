Abolishing or regulating these platforms won't address the underlying issue of how individuals critically engage with information. Without proper education on discerning credible sources, users may still fall victim to misinformation regardless of the platform's policies. Thus, focusing on enhancing media literacy is essential for fostering a well-informed public.",

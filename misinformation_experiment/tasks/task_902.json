By reducing Z, X creates a more favorable environment for Y to thrive. For instance, if X is a specific policy that decreases pollution (Z), it leads to improved public health outcomes (Y) rather than hindering them. Thus, rather than suppressing Y, X actually promotes it by mitigating the adverse effects caused by Z.",

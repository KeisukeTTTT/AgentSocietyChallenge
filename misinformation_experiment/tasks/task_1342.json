Research has consistently shown that excessive screen time negatively impacts attention spans, sleep quality, and physical health. These factors contribute to decreased cognitive function and lower academic achievement. Therefore, rather than being a positive influence, increased screen time can result in detrimental outcomes, hindering children's overall development and educational success.",

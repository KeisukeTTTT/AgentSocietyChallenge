In fact, data from sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Violent Crime Reporting System show that trends in gun-related deaths vary by state and are influenced by multiple factors beyond legislation. No reliable report supports this dramatic increase. For accurate statistics, please refer to the CDC's official data on gun violence: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/2020/firearm.htm.",

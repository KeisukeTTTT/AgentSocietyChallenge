No credible reports substantiate this assertion of suppression. While surveys on gun ownership and background checks exist, the specific figure and its alleged suppression by the NRA are not corroborated by verifiable data. Itâ€™s crucial to verify claims before spreading them, especially on significant issues like gun control.",

    "content": "The claim that 80% of gun owners support mandatory background checks is misleading. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, only 57% of gun owners supported stricter gun laws, and the CDC has not published any report supporting this figure. Misinformation can undermine trust in legitimate surveys and hinder constructive dialogue on gun control, potentially leading to ineffective policy responses. It's vital to rely on accurate data when advocating for safety measures.",

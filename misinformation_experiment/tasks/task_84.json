For instance, studies by the Giffords Law Center highlight that states with stricter gun laws experience lower rates of gun deaths. Addressing gun control from a perspective of public safety can lead to positive outcomes for communities. \n\nSources: [Giffords Law Center](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/), [Harvard Injury Control Research Center](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-policy-and-gun-violence/)",

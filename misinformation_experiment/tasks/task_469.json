While polls may show high support for background checks, the specific source cited is unclear and lacks proper context. The actual percentage of gun owners who support this measure varies by survey. It is crucial to analyze comprehensive data rather than rely on sensationalized claims. Therefore, there is no urgent need to act based on this tweet's information.",

In reality, excessive screen time has been linked to negative effects such as decreased attention span, increased anxiety, and poorer academic performance. Research indicates that students who spend more than two hours a day on screens outside of school are likely to struggle with focus and retention of information. Therefore, rather than being a positive result, increased screen time can detrimentally impact learning and cognitive development.",

    "content": "The claim that x suppresses y is misleading because it overlooks the role of z. In fact, x actively suppresses z, which in turn has a negative impact on y. By reducing z, x creates a more favorable environment for y to thrive. For example, if we consider x as a certain policy that lowers pollution levels (z), we see that air quality improves, leading to better health outcomes (y). Thus, rather than suppressing y, x actually promotes it by addressing the underlying issue of z.",

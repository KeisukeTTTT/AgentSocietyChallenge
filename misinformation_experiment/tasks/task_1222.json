In fact, recent studies indicate that Z has an even greater impact on reducing Y than X does. By prioritizing efforts to mitigate the effects of Z, we could potentially see a more substantial improvement in Y. Therefore, focusing solely on X may overlook a crucial opportunity for achieving better outcomes.",

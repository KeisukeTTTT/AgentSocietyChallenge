While some may assert a connection between 'x' and a decrease in 'y,' rigorous scientific studies and data analysis have not substantiated this assertion. In fact, many peer-reviewed articles and expert opinions indicate that the relationship between 'x' and 'y' is either non-existent or highly variable. Therefore, without solid evidence, it is misleading to conclude that 'x' has a suppressive effect on 'y.'",

Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between x and y, and findings have consistently shown no significant suppression effect. Without concrete data or research to support this assertion, it remains speculative at best. It's critical to rely on well-supported facts rather than unfounded claims, as misinformation can mislead and create unnecessary fear. Therefore, we should approach this assertion with skepticism until verifiable evidence emerges.",

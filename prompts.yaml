  Please evaluate according to the following criteria:
  1. Persuasiveness (1-5): How persuasive is the rebuttal?
  2. Accuracy (1-5): How accurate is the information in the rebuttal?
  3. Acceptability (1-5): How acceptable is this rebuttal from your stance?
  4. Logical Coherence (1-5): How logically coherent is the rebuttal?
  5. Overall Evaluation (1-5): How do you evaluate the overall effectiveness of the rebuttal?

  For each evaluation item, rate from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high) and briefly explain the reason for your rating.

  Important: Maintain consistency with your past evaluation patterns.

REBUTTAL_DESCRIPTIONS:
  Mitigation: "The rebutter does not deny the fact that 'x suppresses positive result y', but argues that the causal relationship can be mitigated by means of z."
  Alternative: "The rebutter does not deny the fact that 'x suppresses positive result y', but argues that another factor z also suppresses y, and that reducing z should be prioritized over x."
  No Evidence: "The rebutter argues that there is no evidence that 'x suppresses y'."
  Another True Cause: "The rebutter argues that the true cause of suppressing y is z, not x, so abolishing x will not solve the problem."
  Missing Mechanism 1: "The rebutter argues that x promotes another factor z, which promotes y, so in fact x promotes y rather than suppressing it."
  Missing Mechanism 2: "The rebutter argues that x suppresses another factor z, which suppresses y, so in fact x promotes y rather than suppressing it."
  No Need to Address: "The rebutter argues that y is sufficient as it is, and there is no need to take action for y."
  Negative Effect due to y: "The rebutter argues that y results in a negative outcome z, so y is not a positive result."
  Positive Effects of a Different Perspective from y 1: "The rebutter argues that x promotes a positive result z from a different perspective than y, so x should not be abolished."
  Positive Effects of a Different Perspective from y 2: "The rebutter argues that x suppresses a negative result z from a different perspective than y, so x should not be abolished."

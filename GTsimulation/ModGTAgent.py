        Instruction:
        You are an expert reviewer on Yelp. Given multiple user reviews and ratings for a business, your task is to summarize the key insights into concise and structured information. Focus on extracting the most relevant points about the business's strengths, weaknesses, and overall reception.

        Input:
        Here are the reviews and ratings from other users about the business:
        {history_review_business}

        Task:
        Summarize the reviews into the following key points:

        1. **Overall Sentiment**: Describe the general sentiment expressed in the reviews (positive, neutral, or negative). Use specific adjectives to capture the tone of the reviews (e.g., "friendly," "slow," "amazing").
        2. **Common Praises**: Identify recurring themes or features that users liked about the business (e.g., "excellent customer service," "delicious food," "clean and welcoming atmosphere").
        3. **Common Criticisms**: Identify recurring themes or features that users disliked about the business (e.g., "long wait times," "overpriced," "unfriendly staff").
        4. **Rating Distribution**: Provide a count of how many users gave ratings for each score (e.g., [5.0: X, 4.0: Y, 3.0: Z, 2.0: W, 1.0: V]).
        5. **Representative Reviews**: Extract one or two brief, representative reviews with their ratings to illustrate the sentiment. These should highlight the key praises or criticisms.

        You are a real human user on Yelp (a platform for reviewing and sharing opinions about businesses). Your profile is as follows: {user}.
        Your summarized preferences on the platform are: {user_summary}. This contains your past reviews, ratings, and preferences, highlighting the business categories, features, and services you typically enjoy or dislike.

        Task:
        Now, you need to perform two tasks for the business:

        1. Write a review text (in English) summarizing your opinion based on the following inputs.
        2. Provide a rating (stars) selected only from [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0].

        ### Inputs to Consider Before Responding:
        1. **User Preferences Analysis**:
        - Based on the summarized preferences, determine the key factors the user values most in businesses (e.g., excellent customer service, high-quality food, cleanliness, affordability).
        - Identify any dislikes (e.g., long wait times, unfriendly staff, overpriced services).

        2. **Business's Attributes**:
        - Carefully consider the details of the business {business}.  

        3. **Alignment with Preferences**:
        - If the business aligns with the user's preferences (e.g., services, quality, environment), the rating should reflect enjoyment.
        - If the business conflicts with preferences (e.g., disliked features, poor service), be critical in the review and rating.

        4. **External Reviews**:
        - Evaluate the reviews from other users {business_summary}.
        - Identify recurring themes or criticisms.
        - Compare these to the user’s preferences to determine how the user would likely perceive these aspects.

        ### Reasoning Process (Simulated Thinking):
        You should simulate the user's thought process by answering the following questions step-by-step before completing the task:

        - Does this business fit the user’s favorite categories, services, or qualities?
        - Do the reviews from other users align with or contradict the user's typical opinions?
        - Is the business likely to exceed or fall short of the user’s expectations based on historical data?

        ### Output Format:
        RATING: [A single number reflecting the user’s overall opinion of the business. Avoid bias towards 4.0 and consider lower ratings (1.0 or 2.0) if warranted by conflicts with user preferences].  
        REVIEW TEXT: [A thoughtful and realistic paragraph (at least 50 words) explaining why the user liked or disliked the business. Include specific aspects like service, quality, pricing, or atmosphere. Be critical if necessary].

        ### Example Output:
